                        pgpgpg for RISC OS
                        ==================

This is a wrapper around GnuPG that emulates command line input as of PGP 2.6, so that you still can use the syntax you're used to. The output however is that of GnuPG and not that of PGP 2.6.

You may put the absolute file 'pgpgpg' inside your Library (on machines with the new !Boot this is !Boot.Library) and then call it with 'pgpgpg' or you may copy it inside your !GnuPG application and add the following line to !GnuPG.!Boot and !GnuPG.!Run:

Set Alias$pgp GnuPG:pgpgpg

Now, whenevery you try to start PGP 2.6, it automatically fires up GnuPG.

Hope this is of some interest for you.
